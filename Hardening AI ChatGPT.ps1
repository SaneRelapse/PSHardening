# Apply mitigation policies to ChatGPT.exe

# Data Execution Prevention: Prevents code from being run in areas of memory that should only contain data.
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name ChatGPT.exe -Enable DEP

# ForceRelocateImages: Forces relocation of code images to avoid fixed addresses which attackers could target.
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name ChatGPT.exe -Enable ForceRelocateImages

# HighEntropy: Enforces higher entropy for address space layout randomization, making attacks harder.
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name ChatGPT.exe -Enable HighEntropy

# Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP): Mitigates exploits targeting SEH (Structured Exception Handlers).
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name ChatGPT.exe -Enable SEHOP

# Control Flow Guard (CFG): Helps protect against certain types of control-flow hijacking attacks (e.g., ROP-based attacks).
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name ChatGPT.exe -Enable CFG

# TerminateOnError: Terminates the process if an error is encountered, reducing the potential for exploitation.

# DO NOT ENABLE BlockDynamicCode IT WILL BREAK ChatGPT
# This script attempts to prevent attackers including hackers from attacking ChatGPT
# This may provide a meager safeguard in the chance that Ai goes rogue.... By
# Data Execution Prevention (DEP):
# How it helps: DEP marks certain regions of memory as non-executable (such as the stack and heap), 
# meaning that even if the program tries to write to these regions and then execute the code from them, 
# it will be blocked.
# Impact on self-modifying code: If ChatGPT tries to modify its own code in memory (e.g., through a buffer overflow 
# that writes and executes new code), DEP will prevent this from happening by ensuring that data regions cannot be executed as code.

# ForceRelocateImages:
# How it helps: This forces the relocation of code images at runtime. It randomizes where the program’s code and data 
# are loaded in memory, making it harder for attackers or the program itself to target specific memory regions.
# Impact on self-modifying code: If ChatGPT tries to modify its own code or change its memory layout in predictable ways, 
# ForceRelocateImages makes it difficult by making memory locations less predictable.

# HighEntropy:
# How it helps: HighEntropy increases the randomness of address space layout randomization (ASLR), making it more difficult 
# to predict where different components of the application are loaded in memory.
# Impact on self-modifying code: This makes it harder for the application (or an attacker) to target specific parts of the program's 
# memory, reducing the chance of self-modifying code being executed or injected.

# Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP):
# How it helps: SEHOP protects the integrity of the structured exception handling (SEH) chain, which can be targeted in 
# buffer overflow attacks to change control flow.
# Impact on self-modifying code: If an attacker or malicious code tries to exploit an SEH-based vulnerability to modify the 
# program’s control flow, SEHOP will block it. This indirectly prevents some forms of self-modifying behavior by protecting 
# how the program handles exceptions.

# Control Flow Guard (CFG):
# How it helps: CFG helps protect the program from control-flow hijacking attacks, ensuring that only valid control-flow 
# paths are executed.
# Impact on self-modifying code: If ChatGPT tries to execute modified code or jump to an unexpected location (as part of a 
# self-modifying process), CFG would detect and block this attempt.

# TerminateOnError:
# How it helps: If an error occurs, the process will terminate immediately.
# Impact on self-modifying code: If the program tries to change its code or encounter an error while doing so, TerminateOnError 
# would immediately stop execution, preventing further exploitation or unintended behavior.

# EnableExportAddressFilter and EnableImportAddressFilter:
# How they help: These filters prevent attackers from modifying exported or imported function addresses, respectively.
# Impact on self-modifying code: If the program or an attacker tries to modify function addresses in the import or export tables 
# (e.g., to reroute function calls to modified code), these mitigations will block that.

# EnableRopStackPivot and EnableRopCallerCheck:
# How they help: These mitigate return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks, which could potentially involve the execution of 
# malicious code.
# Impact on self-modifying code: If ChatGPT attempts to pivot the stack to execute self-modifying code via a ROP chain, 
# these mitigations would detect the abnormal stack changes and block them.

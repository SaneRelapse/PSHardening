.SYNOPSIS
    Hardening AI CoPilot (copilot.exe) with advanced Windows exploit mitigations.
.DESCRIPTION
    Applies a hardened mitigation profile to GitHub Copilot's executable
    to reduce attack surface using Set-ProcessMitigation.
    Requires administrative privileges.

# Apply mitigation policies to copilot.exe

# Data Execution Prevention: Prevents code from being run in areas of memory that should only contain data.
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name copilot.exe -Enable DEP

# ForceRelocateImages: Forces relocation of code images to avoid fixed addresses which attackers could target.
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name copilot.exe -Enable ForceRelocateImages

# HighEntropy: Enforces higher entropy for address space layout randomization, making attacks harder.
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name copilot.exe -Enable HighEntropy

# Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP): Mitigates exploits targeting SEH (Structured Exception Handlers).
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name copilot.exe -Enable SEHOP

# Control Flow Guard (CFG): Helps protect against certain types of control-flow hijacking attacks (e.g., ROP-based attacks).
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name copilot.exe -Enable CFG

# TerminateOnError: Terminates the process if an error is encountered, reducing the potential for exploitation.
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name copilot.exe -Enable TerminateOnError

# EnableExportAddressFilter: Protects the addresses of exported functions, making it harder for exploits to target them.
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name copilot.exe -Enable EnableExportAddressFilter

# EnableImportAddressFilter: Protects imported function addresses from being manipulated by attackers.
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name copilot.exe -Enable EnableImportAddressFilter

# EnableRopStackPivot: Protects against return-oriented programming (ROP) stack pivoting attacks by detecting malicious stack changes.
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name copilot.exe -Enable EnableRopStackPivot

# EnableRopCallerCheck: Ensures that the call stack is checked to block ROP attacks using malicious function calls.
Set-ProcessMitigation -Name copilot.exe -Enable EnableRopCallerCheck

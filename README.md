# PSHardening
PSHardening: A curated collection of advanced PowerShell scripts designed to automate cyber security measures and harden Windows systems. This repository empowers IT professionals, Home User &amp; the Ultra paranoid to enforce security baselines, streamline Port security, providing robust defenses against evolving cyber threats &amp; Cyber terrorism.
It's my goal to prevent Corporate espionage, and to prevent intelectual property theft of everyday persons all over the world.
Make sure to backup your firewall before use.
Consult a cyber security professional before implementing these scripts on your networks....

Note: If you frequently use network-connected printers on your local network, these hardening scripts may not be ideal for you. Personally, I avoid exposing printers to my network due to their well-documented vulnerabilities and instead transfer files via USB for printing at trusted external locations like Staples. Printers remain one of the most frequently targeted and exploited devices in local network environments.
Scripts have only been tested on Windows 11 Home, Always check your registry values before implementing.

Concerns regarding the License: License was created with the purpose to discourage boycotting products including software products based on Country of origin. Canada, Denmark is the only known countrys currently implementing these practices. The license may be subject to change in the coming years depending on nation by nation conduct. While the USA did implement Tarrifs(Tax) they did not advocate for discrimination.
Github.com is Allowed to host the scripts to all nations but that doesn't mean they (the nations) can lawfully download them.

The license is to serve as a example of what the future of Cybersecurity and software may look like if we go down the path of discrimination.
